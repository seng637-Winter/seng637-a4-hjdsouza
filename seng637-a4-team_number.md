# Introduction

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
6. Update Quantity in Cart
   Objective: Ensure that the user can update the quantity of an item in the cart and that the cart updates correctly.
   Steps: Add an item to the cart, navigate to the cart, update the quantity of the item, and confirm the update.
   Expected Result: The quantity of the item updates correctly, and the cart reflects the new quantity and total price.
7. Switch Lanuage from English to French
   Objective: Ensure that the website correctly switches the interface language from English to French upon user selection
   Steps: Find the lanuage seletion option and select "French" from the available options
   Expected Result: The website content, like navigation menus switches to French
8. Change store location 
    Objective: Ensure that users can successfully change their default store location on the website.
    Steps: Navigate to the store selection area, select a new store, confirm the selection and then verify the change.
    Expected Result: Verify that the display name of the store (often found at the top of the webpage or within the store selection area) updates to reflect the newly selected store.
9. Navigate to a Specific Department
  Objective: Ensure the user can navigate to a specific department from the homepage.
  Steps: From the homepage, click on a department category (e.g., "Appliances").
  Expected Result: The website redirects to the selected department page showing relevant products and categories.
10. Use the Site Search with a Blank Query
  Objective: Ensure the search functionality handles blank queries gracefully.
  Steps: Go to the search bar, enter nothing (leave it blank), and press enter or click the search icon.
  Expected Result: The website either prompts the user to enter a search term or displays a message indicating no search term was entered.
# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
## For the "Update Quantity in Cart" objective
1. Verify Item Quantity Updates for 
   After updating the quantity of an item in the cart, assert that the displayed quantity matches the new amount. This verifies that the input for quantity change is correctly processed and displayed. "assert text" was used as the assertion command
2. Check for Correct Cart State
   After updating the quantity of an item in the cart, assert that the displayed quantity of the amount of items in the cart refelct correctly. This verifies that the input for quantity change is correctly processed and displayed. "assert text" was used as the assertion command
## For the "Switch Lanuage from English to French" objective
1. Check Navigation Menu Text
   After changing from English to french verify if the main page title changes once you click any department. The command used was "assert text"
2. Validate English option is available
   After French is selection, a user should have the option to switch back to English right away. The command used was "assert text"
## For the "Use site search with a blank query objective"
1. Check if the Front page title changes
   With the home depot website, if a blank query is sent no change happens. So we used an "assert text" to see if any changes were made on the front made
## For the "Changing the default store location"
1. Store Name Update: Verify the display name of the store is the newly selected store using 'assert text'
2. Selection is consistent across sessions/pages: Verify that if you navigate to different pages or refreshing the pages keeps the new store selection. This would use 'assert text'

## For the "Navigating to a specfic department"
1. Validate Specfic department name
   Once the page has been changed to a new department use 'assert text' to check if the name has been updated correctly. 

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data
1. Update Quantity in Cart
For this test case, we played with different quanitites to update the cart with such as 3 and to see if this was correctly being reflected.
2. Switch Language from English to French
Here, the variation in test data could involve switching to different languages supported by the website, not just French. So instead of French we pick Spanish and verified that the change was succesful 

Data Variations: Different languages the website supports, such as French, Spanish, and English.
Implementing Data-Driven Testing: Loop through the language options, selecting each one, and verify the UI changes accordingly. Use the select command to change the language and assert text to verify that the language switch was successful.
3. Change Store Location
This functionality can be tested with different store locations to ensure the application correctly updates the store information and related inventory or prices.

Data Variations: Different store locations, ideally covering a diverse geographical range.
Implementing Data-Driven Testing: Automate the process of selecting each store location from your test data set and verify the expected outcomes using assert commands. Use the click and type commands to navigate the store selection and input different locations.
4. Navigate to a Specific Department
Testing navigation to different departments ensures that all sections of the website are accessible and load correctly.

Data Variations: Different department names or categories available on the website.
Implementing Data-Driven Testing: Create a loop or series of tests that navigate to each department using the department names as inputs. Verify each navigation with assert commands that check you've landed on the correct page.
5. Use the Site Search with a Blank Query
This test checks how the site handles blank searches, but you can extend it to handle searches for various valid and invalid search terms.

Data Variations: A blank query, valid search terms, invalid search terms, and special characters.
Implementing Data-Driven Testing: Automate the submission of these different search queries and use assert commands to verify the appropriate response for each (e.g., results for valid terms, no results or suggestions for invalid ones).
